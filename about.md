<img src="assets/images/bio.jpeg" style="float: left; padding-right: 10px;" width="300">

Oi! My name is Giovana. I hold a Bachelors degree in Computer Science by
[Universidade Federal
de São Carlos](www.dcomp.sor.ufscar.br) (UFSCar Sorocaba) and a Master's degree
in Computer Science by
Universidade de São Paulo (USP), where I was part of the
[COMPMUS](https://compmus.ime.usp.br/) group and advised by [Prof. Dr. Marcelo
Queiroz](https://www.ime.usp.br/~mqz/). Nowadays, I'm a PhD Candidate in
Computer Science at New
York University (NYU). I am part of the
Music and Audio Research Laboratory, also known as
[MARL](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/marl), where I am advised by
[Dr. Magdalena Fuentes](https://magdalenafuentes.github.io/).

My main research interests are music information retrieval (MIR), machine
learning, deep learning and explainability. I am currently interested in
multimodal models (audio-vision, audio-text) and how they use audio information.
I am particularly interested in latin american repertoires. How surprising,
right? You can see more about my research on the [Publications
page](publications).

I love doing research as much as I love doing anything else. I like to
contribute to open-source code with bug reports, translations, code and
documentation. To chill, I love to cycle, to spend some time with my family, to
read, to draw, to stay under the sun like a lizard, to write badly, to eat
fruits under a tree, to listen to music and to learn about whatever I am
interested in the moment.
