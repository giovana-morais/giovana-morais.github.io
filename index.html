<section>
	<p>I am a PhD Candidate at New York University and a member of the Music and
	Audio Research (MARL) lab, where I am supervised by Magdalena Fuentes. I am
	interested in multimodal models (audio-vision, audio-text), explainability
	techniques and music information retrieval. I like to think about Deep
	Learning from a data-centric perspective, investigating how biased datasets
	can affect model behavior and how we can explain a model output.
