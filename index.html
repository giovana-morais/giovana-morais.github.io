	<p>I am a PhD Candidate at New York University. I am part of the Music and
	Audio Research lab and I am supervised by Magdalena Fuentes. I am interested in multimodal models (audio-vision, audio-text),
	explainability techniques and music information retrieval. I like to think
	about Deep Learning from a data-centric perspective, investigating how biased
	datasets can affect model behavior and how we can explain model output.
	</p>
	<p>Before, I was part of the COMPMUS group at Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo, supervised by
	Marcelo Queiroz.</p>
	<p>I love music, enjoying outside, drawing, reading, biking and chilling under
	a tree. I also love to develop random side projects, such as this website
	theme.</p>
